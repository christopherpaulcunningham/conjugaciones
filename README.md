# Conjugaciones

Conjugaciones is a React web app for practicing Spanish verb conjugations. 

The most difficult aspect of learning Spanish for me is the correct conjugation of verbs, and knowing when to use each. The goal of this project was to not only create something for my portfolio that I could use to demonstrate my skills, but also to create something that would solve a personal problem for me.

The idea is relatively simple - select which tense(s) you want to practice, along with the pronoun(s) you wish to include, and the app will create a quiz for you. Select one tense that you've been struggling with, or all of them for some general practice. You can also choose to practice individual verbs that might be giving you trouble by using the 'custom verbs' option.

The live application can be found on Netlify [here](https://conjugaciones.netlify.app).
